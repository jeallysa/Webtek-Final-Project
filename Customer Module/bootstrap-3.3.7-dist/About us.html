      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Webtek was founded on the belief that live video is a powerful source of truth and connects us in an authentic way with the world around us. We are fascinated by the idea of discovering the world through someone else’s eyes. <br>
	  Our powerful technology makes it easy for everyone to get online with
a stunning, professional and functional web presence. No creative limits, no coding – just complete freedom to express yourself and manage your entire business online..</p>
      <br><br>
	  <h2>Mission</h2>
	   <p>To be the institution that recognizes, understands and responds to individual learning needs by providing more challenges and opportunities for learners to value perseverance, commitment, responsibility, self-discipline, and honesty in academic achievements as well as professional development.
	   <br>
	   We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that's not changing. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot. And frankly, we don't settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we're wrong and the courage to change. And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that we will do extremely well.
